# Information On Git and Github
If you have not used git or github please checkout the resources below:

if you have not used git before it can be kind of weird, but you won't need to do anything to crazy with it, so those tutorial will cover basically anything you need to do here.


If you are not familiar with git and github this is short tutorial on how it works: https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/
This is another option https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/


**Definetly take advantage of your IDEs ability to help you manage Git repos (most have a built in tool to let you do all the git functions)**
The most important things here are making sure to write new features in "branches", doing frequent "commits" to save your progress, and then once everything is working "mergingn" your code back into the 
main branch and "pushing" the code to the github repo.
